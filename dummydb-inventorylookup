def check_spare_part_availability(part_id: str) -> str:
    """
    Checks the availability of a spare part in various warehouse locations.

    Args:
        part_id (str): The ID of the part to check for availability.

    Returns:
        list of dict or str: A list of dictionaries containing locations and quantities
        where the part is available if it is in stock. Each dictionary has keys:
        - "location" (str): The warehouse location of the part.
        - "quantity" (int): The available quantity of the part at that location.
        
        If the part is out of stock at all locations, returns a string message indicating
        that the part is unavailable.

    Example:
        >>> check_spare_part_availability("P123")
        [{'location': 'Warehouse A', 'quantity': 5}]
        
        >>> check_spare_part_availability("P124")
